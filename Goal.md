# REAL GOAL

The actual goal depends on the organization being evaluated and can be expressed in a very brief or detailed manner, but it is by no means a guarantee that the red teaming operation will be carried out in a specific way.

It is important to understand that a red teaming exercise arises as a need to subject those who manage IT and even less those who manage security (whether internal and/or external) to less protocolary tests without detailed notice. In this sense, mapping the results to the organization's processes and the affected information assets is the most appropriate way to review the red and blue teams as a whole.

## ANALIZE TTD, TTM AND OTHER ELEMENTS 

Detections produced during the development of the operation must be analyzed, determining complete or partial detections as well as complete or partial mitigations. Within this aspect, the measurement of the time required for them must be mapped to the time of impact on business processes.

Other elements of analysis may be:
- The good or bad operation of the SOC
- Evaluate the performance of the Blue Team (external and/or internal)
- Evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of technological protection tools (especially those based on ML and/or AI, etc.)

## REPORT

It should consist of a descriptive narrative of the process carried out that allows us to understand the sequence of actions executed, including those that were not successful. In this way, we can have clear indicators to improve the functioning of the implemented security components and determine which ones should be added or, even, which ones should be eliminated for being inefficient and/or ineffective.

Finally, this report becomes a kind of SWOT document that should provide the necessary elements to improve security not only in the assurance aspect but also in the way in which other security tests performed more frequently are conducted, such as pentests.

There are some tools that allow us to condense all this information and obtain comparisons and trends to support management.
